Which Laravel patterns you'd use for the status logic and permissions

2. Migration Assessment (1 page max)

Hours estimate to properly migrate this file
Dependencies you'd need to investigate (those includes, the $UTB_CONFIG, etc.)
Testing approach for the complex status calculations
One thing that could break in production if migrated incorrectly

3. Biggest Concern
